MITMS -- A tool for synthesizing quantum circuits based on the
         "meet-in-the-middle" algorithm (arXiv:1206.0758)

BUILD

To build mitms, run make in the top level folder to produce an
executable "mitms." mitms requires the following libraries to be installed

-- Lapack
-- Blas
-- Lapack++

Lapack and Blas (I forget whether they're separate) can be a massive pain
to compile, so if you can get them through your package manager, that is
much preferred.

Lapack++ can be found on sourceforge by searching either lapack++ or lapackpp.
Compiling it shouldn't be too difficult, but if you install it outside of
/usr or /usr/local you may have to modify the makefile

Additionally, if your compiler doesn't support the c++0x/c++11 standard,
you'll need to change HAS_HASH in configs.h to "false" and probably remove
std=c++0x from the Makefile.
